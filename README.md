<strong>Rat World!</strong> is a virtual pet experience: the perfect place to go if you're looking for a brand new pet! Friendly! Clever! Kind of cute (if you can get over the tail): a <strong><em>rat makes the perfect pet</em></strong> - and now you can have all the fun of owning one of your own...<strong><em>without having to put up with that smell.</em></strong>

<strong>Rat World!</strong> is a full-stack application built with the <strong>MERN</strong> stack:
 - <strong>React</strong> in the front end;
 -  <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> back-end;
 - <strong>MongoDB</strong> database with <strong>Mongoose</strong> ODM;
 - Querying in <strong>GraphQL</strong>;
 -  <strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong>, <strong>Session Cookies</strong> and <strong>bcrypt</strong> for authentication and encryption.

We built this <strong>collaboratively</strong> (with <em>[Git for version control](https://github.com/BGrowcott/untitled-rat-project/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)</em>) as a team of five: <strong>[Daniel Bowen](https://github.com/djbowen95)</strong>, [Ben Growcott](https://github.com/BGrowcott), [Fatumo Abdullahi](https://github.com/Fatumoabdullahi), [Girish Madnani](https://github.com/gmadnani) and [Ayaanle Nur](https://github.com/anuur7). This was our final project for the <strong>[University of Birmingham and Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.birmingham.ac.uk/coding/landing/?s=Google-Brand&dki=Learn%20coding%20and%20more%20online&pkw=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&pcrid=454943464528&pmt=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-BIRMINGHAM%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CBRD%7CEXACT%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&s=google&k=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_adgroupid=105037008614&utm_locationphysicalms=9045530&utm_matchtype=e&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=454943464528&utm_placement=&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwvilBhCFARIsADvYi7Iiaw7mX3Os-6hB3ilO7yuoW5PTNV_VtYzMSm8S68uEnJL-nTD5dvEaAkShEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)</strong>. It was built, as <strong><em>an agile sprint</em></strong>, over the final two weeks of the course; designed to showcase everything we had learned. We're really proud of what we managed to built and we would love you to take a look!

`NOTE: Currently working on redeploying the application - as it was deployed under the Heroku free membership tier at the time we built it. - Daniel`

## About
### Project History
This was a group project, built with a team of five, which we had two weeks to complete and which we presented to the entire class. We brainstormed ideas and the idea that turned into Rat World! was thrown out as a joke, or a curveball, but we ultimately felt like it was the most fun/unique idea that we had. We got to test every skill that we learned on the course, and felt that even though it was a novelty idea, perhaps it was too ambitious to deliver in two weeks: however we had a lot of fun, as did everyone we presented to, and we're really pleased with the product.
Feedback - maybe a seperate section; employers calling it inventive. Explain the day event thing. John's feedback specifically.
### Developing the Project
Coming up with an idea -> Trialing the Agile style -> Working with Version control -> Getting Ready to Present
We were taught Agile software developer principles in the course and encouraged to give it a go. We only had two weeks to work on the project, so we'd call what we did 'mock agile' - but we tried to work towards different minimal viable products (users can sign in/out, can adopt a rat... then add extra features), with working deadlines of 3-4 days for each feature. We also split into teams of 2-3 to try and get more features done by the deadline. While we were limited for time - I think we got a good sense of why managing a project like this in Agile would be a good idea.
We learned and worked with version control across the project - but this was probably where we put that to the test the most. Every new feature, new page, new section was built on its own branch - and we tried to merge at each class (so every couple of days) so that everyone had a similar working version of the project to contribute to. Ben took a technical lead role and worked on resolving merge conflicts etc, but we tried to make sure everyone was involved in the whole process.
Our presentation had a specific set of marking criteria we had to talk through, which gave our presentation structure. You can see our presentation slides below.  
### Demonstration Video
The presentation we gave at the end of the project was recorded, I will try to edit/upload this recording soon, with permission from my team! In the mean time, here are links to the slides that we used for our presentation:

Daniel also presented this project as part of the career event 2U/Trilogy organised for us after the course - updated/revised slide, a little more formal. Had some really great feedback.

### Live Deployment
This project was deployed on Heroku at the time we built it: however sadly now, as they have changed their free membership, it is no longer deployed with them. I'm hoping to deploy this with AWS/an EC2 instance in the near future. In the meantime - to see the project in action, please follow the installation instructions below.
## Usage
This section will be revised with more screenshots or animated GIFs demonstrating the main user features of the application.  
These are the working titles for my headings:  
Creating an account -> Adopt a rat -> Learn about your rat -> Find your rat a job -> Visit the shop -> Get your rat a job  
Below are the notes from the old README on usage.  
### Key Usage A
Upon visting the RatHub website you will be prensenting with a login/signup page. In order to proceed further into application you will need to create an account and log in. 

Once you have logged in you will be presented with the opportunity to adopt your first rat - click the Adopt a Rat button! This will open the rat designer and allow you to customise the look of your rat, name it and adopt it.

After adopting your rat you will be taken back to the View My Rats page and your new rat will be visible with all of it's information. Each rat has it's own Rattributes and ChaRATeristics.

Much of the app is still under construction or in need of some polishing, but you can buy items/food, feed your rat and find it a job.

## Key Features
This section will be revised to talk through the technical aspects of Rat World!: the skills we were asked to demonstrate; the understanding it shows; the technologies we brought in beyond what was taught on the course.
### Key Feature A
I think this list is the technology I want to talk about here, and these will roughly be the headings:
    - MongoDB (subdocuments, mongoose, virtuals/aggregates maybe?)
    - React (event handling, jsx, props, state, hooks, react router)
    - GraphQL / Apollo (queries, mutations, server/client, react usemutation)
    - JWT, apollo cache, bcrypt, uuids, anything else?
    - Express and Node, routing, testing in postman, etc.
    - Our own libraries (react draggable)
### Technology Stack
This is a list of all of the technology we used in the main application.  
### Frontend
----
- ReactJS
- Custom CSS
- jQuery
----
### Backend
----
- NodeJS
- Express
- Apollo
- GraphQL
- bcrypt
- JSON Web Token
- Mongo DB
- Mongoose
## Installation
This section will be a guide for cloning the repository, spinning up the database and running the full application locally. 
### Prerequisities
MongoDB Atlas/Compass; node/npm; anything else?  
### Cloning the Repository
Will keep this short and instructions for doing this with a .zip, with a link to instructions on how to do it with an SSH Key.
### Running the Project Locally
Fairly simple (navigate to the right folder -> npm install -> npm run start); might be worth including some tests.
## Testing
This project was built in two weeks - and so we did not feel we had time to build unit tests. We did, however, cover both unit testing with Jest and the React Testing Library within the scope of the course. These might be features we are able to add at a later date.
## Version History
### Version 1.0.0: Bootvcamp Version
This is the version of the project as it was when we presented it, at the end of our Bootcamp program, in June 2023.
## License
I think its MIT. I need to check! 
## Contribution
### Meet the Contributors
I need to ad a link to everyone's GitHub, LinkedIn, email if they want me to!

### Contribution Guidelines
## Contributing
Although we haven't worked on it lately, both Daniel and Ben were really keen at the end of the course to develop a few extra features/keep building this project, because it was a lot of fun to work on. If you're keen to contribute, please do not hesitate to contact either of us!

### Future Development
Lots to talk about here!

In the very short term we are ironing out kinks and completing the functionality of the current features:

- Feeding your rat
  - Feeding your rat will require the use of an item you've bought.
  - Different foods bought in the shop will provide levels of sustenuance.

- Getting a job
  - Jobs will have requirements e.g Grand Wizard job will have a ChaRATeristic require meant of level 5.
 
- Search the Trash
  - Searching the trash once per day will provide the user with a random item

- Cemetary 
  - Rats can actually die when they are left uncared for.
  - Dead rats will appear in the graveyard

- Friends
  - Allow a user to connect with others and view their rats

Longer term:

  - Mini games
  - Rat battles
  - Rats in love
  - Happiness rating
  - More lore
  - Rat health and medicine
  - More items and grater customisation of your rats
  - Features more complex in general
