<strong>Rat World!</strong> is a virtual pet experience: the perfect place to go if you're looking for a brand new pet! Friendly! Clever! Kind of cute (if you can get over the tail): a <strong><em>rat makes the perfect pet</em></strong> - and now you can have all the fun of owning one of your own...<strong><em>without having to put up with that smell.</em></strong>

<strong>Rat World!</strong> is a full-stack application built with the <strong>MERN</strong> stack:
 - <strong>React</strong> in the front end;
 -  <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> back-end;
 - <strong>MongoDB</strong> database with <strong>Mongoose</strong> ODM;
 - Querying in <strong>GraphQL</strong>;
 -  <strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong>, <strong>Session Cookies</strong> and <strong>bcrypt</strong> for authentication and encryption.

We built this <strong>collaboratively</strong> (with <em>[Git for version control](https://github.com/BGrowcott/untitled-rat-project/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)</em>) as a team of five: <strong>[Daniel Bowen](https://github.com/djbowen95)</strong>, [Ben Growcott](https://github.com/BGrowcott), [Fatumo Abdullahi](https://github.com/Fatumoabdullahi), [Girish Madnani](https://github.com/gmadnani) and [Ayaanle Nur](https://github.com/anuur7). This was our final project for the <strong>[University of Birmingham and Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.birmingham.ac.uk/coding/landing/?s=Google-Brand&dki=Learn%20coding%20and%20more%20online&pkw=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&pcrid=454943464528&pmt=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-BIRMINGHAM%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CBRD%7CEXACT%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&s=google&k=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_adgroupid=105037008614&utm_locationphysicalms=9045530&utm_matchtype=e&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=454943464528&utm_placement=&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwvilBhCFARIsADvYi7Iiaw7mX3Os-6hB3ilO7yuoW5PTNV_VtYzMSm8S68uEnJL-nTD5dvEaAkShEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)</strong>. It was built, as <strong><em>an agile sprint</em></strong>, over the final two weeks of the course; designed to showcase everything we had learned. We're really proud of what we managed to built and we would love you to take a look!

`NOTE: Currently working on redeploying the application - as it was deployed under the Heroku free membership tier at the time we built it. - Daniel`

## Project History
This project was built for the [University of Birmingham and Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.birmingham.ac.uk/coding/landing/?s=Google-Brand&dki=Learn%20coding%20and%20more%20online&pkw=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&pcrid=454943464528&pmt=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-BIRMINGHAM%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CBRD%7CEXACT%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&s=google&k=university%20of%20birmingham%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_adgroupid=105037008614&utm_locationphysicalms=9045530&utm_matchtype=e&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=454943464528&utm_placement=&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwvilBhCFARIsADvYi7Iiaw7mX3Os-6hB3ilO7yuoW5PTNV_VtYzMSm8S68uEnJL-nTD5dvEaAkShEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), an intensive 24-course with a minimum 20-hour requirement, which we were all enrolled on between November 2021 and June 2022. It was our final project for the course - we were tasked to create a full-stack application from scratch, using everything we had learned on the course. To meet the requirements of the brief, we had to: 
 - Use React for the front-end;
 - Use Node.js and Express for the back-end;
 -
